Advanced FP Course
=====================

You
---

* Have completed, or are capable of completing, the [Data61 FP Course](https://github.com/data61/fp-course)
* Have a few months self-study to your name
* Want to know how to build larger applications with statically typed FP
* Are willing to accept that a web application is a sufficient choice

We
--

* Have constructed a sequence of goals of increasing difficulty
* Have provided a framework within which to apply these goals
* Have included relevant components of larger applications:
  - Package dependencies
  - Project configuration
  - Application testing & building
  - Persistent storage integration
  - App state & configuration management
  - Error handling & reporting
* Will utilise both type & test driven development techniques
* Will explain architectural and design trade-offs when appropriate

Ultimate Goal
===============

This course aims to teach some of the techniques for building a larger
application with FP, using Haskell. By the end of this course you should be
comfortable tackling more advanced projects, and expanding on the concepts and
choices presented here in your own future efforts.

We will build an ultra basic web application and build upon it.

1) Hello, Haskell Web
2) Config (read file -> pass-the-parcel)
3) Basic MTL (Config moved to ReaderT)
4) ...
5) ...
6) profit???
