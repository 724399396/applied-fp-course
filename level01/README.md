# Level 01

The purpose of this exercise to whet our appetite a bit by spinning up an ultra
basic web app. The focus will be on reading the [Hackage] documentation for the
[Wai] framework. Consult the ``src/FirstApp/Main.hs`` to see the parts that are
missing and what we need from the [Wai] package to make our "Hello, World!"
application run.
